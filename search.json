    "text": "About\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst. Clicking the image redirects to her Twitter page.\n\n\nIn a sentence, this practicum is all about learning the tools and workflows you need to gain insight from data. While there are many excellent software platforms that you could use to do data science (see Power BI, Tableau, Python, and Julia), we will strictly be using R and the tidyverse. I’ve chosen this approach for three main reasons: (1) open source solutions are more accessible than proprietary tools (e.g., Power BI and Tableau) for reproducibility, (2) the tidyverse features a more consistent design philosophy than other curated package suites (e.g., Anaconda), and (3) the online learning community that has assembled around R and the tidyverse is large, active, and welcoming (start here to get involved).\nOver the course of the next eight weeks we’ll work together to learn how to program in R, use tools from the tidyverse to wrangle and visualize data, and put all of this knowledge into action through partnerships with campus stakeholders to address pressing institutional challenges using data-based insights and solutions. Wowzers, when I write it all out like this it sounds so rad!"

In macOS, select the .pkg file that corresponds to your system hardware (M1/M2 vs. intel processor). If you’re unsure go to  &gt; About This Mac and look at your processor specs.\n\nIn both Windows and macOS, the software should be sent to your Downloads folder. Double-click the .exe (Windows) or .pkg (macOS) file to start the installation. Accept all defaults (i.e., don’t fiddle with anything – just be agreeable and keep clicking “Continue”)."

Click with determination and maybe they’ll actually believe that we want the software this time.\n\nOn Windows machines, I believe your browser will download a .exe file that you can run to install RStudio Desktop. In macOS, a .dmg file is sent to your Downloads folder. You must double-click this file, and drag the RStudio icon into your Applications folder. Next, locate the RStudio disk image icon that has appeared on your Desktop and drag it to Trash to unmount. Once the ritual is complete, you’re safe to delete the .dmg file from your Downloads folder."

You’ve received an email containing an invite link to our DataCamp classroom. Click the link and sign up using your Gordon email address. Once enrolled, you’ll see an assignment called “Analytic Fundamentals” that I’ve asked you to complete by 11:59 pm on May 29th. This is a short, timed assessment that will no doubt stress the heck out of you. You’ll answer roughly 10 questions about basic analytics scenarios and statistical concepts. DO NOT SWEAT THIS ASSESSMENT. The results will have no impact on your life. I just wanted to collect some useful data while giving you an opportunity to practice using the DataCamp website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou must access the assessment through our classroom page in order for me to track your completion of the assignment."
