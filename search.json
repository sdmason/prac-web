This website provides information and resources related to the lecture portion of the practicum, and should serve as a useful reference during team project work. Two cool things up front: (1) the awesome artwork above was created by @allison_horst, and (2) this entire website was written in RStudio using Quarto – a powerful and flexible scientific publishing system that we’ll learn to help document and present our work."

    "text": "Orientation tasks\nThe practicum doesn’t begin until Tuesday, May 30th, but there are some things I’d like you to accomplish prior to our first meeting so that we can hit the ground running!\n\nDownload and install R v4.3.0 on your personal laptop.\nDownload and install RStudio v2023.03.1+446 on your personal laptop.\nJoin our DataCamp classroom (see relevant email).\nRead the first chapter of our textbook, R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.\n\n\nInstalling R\n\nHead to http://r-project.org and click on “CRAN” under the Download section of the left-hand navigation panel.\n\nClick on 0-Cloud URL from the list of CRAN mirrors.\n\nSelect the download link corresponding to your operating system.\n\nOn Windows machines click on the “install R for the first time” hyperlink. In macOS, select the .pkg file that corresponds to your system hardware (M1/M2 vs. intel processor). If you’re unsure go to  > About This Mac and look at your processor specs.\n\nIn both Windows and macOS, the software should be sent to your Downloads folder. Double-click the .exe (Windows) or .pkg (macOS) file to start the installation. Accept all defaults (i.e., don’t fiddle with anything – just be agreeable and keep clicking “Continue”).\n\n\n\n\nInstalling RStudio\n\nHead to http://posit.co and click on the huge, blue “DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO” button.\n\nScroll down a bit until you see another (slightly smaller) “DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO” button and click it.\n\nScroll down a bit until you see yet another big, blue button, this time promising to download the desktop version of RStudio specific to your operating system. Click with determination and maybe they’ll actually believe that we want the software this time.\n\nOn Windows machines, I believe your browser will download a .exe file that you can run to install RStudio Desktop. In macOS, a .dmg file is sent to your Downloads folder. You must double-click this file, and drag the RStudio icon into your Applications folder. Next, locate the RStudio disk image icon that has appeared on your Desktop and drag it to Trash to eject. Once the ritual is complete, you’re safe to delete the .dmg file from your Downloads folder."
