Welcome the summer Data Science Practicum at Gordon College! This website provides information and resources related to the lecture portion of the practicum, and should serve as a useful reference during team project work. Two cool things up front: (1) the awesome artwork above was created by [\@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst), and (2) this entire website was written in RStudio using Quarto -- a powerful and flexible scientific publishing system that we'll learn to document and present our work.
