## Welcome

Hi there! This website provides information and resources related to the Data Science Practicum at [Gordon College](https://www.gordon.edu). One cool thing right off the top, this entire site was written in RStudio using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) -- a powerful and flexible scientific publishing system that we'll learn about during our first case study!

In a sentence, this practicum is all about learning the tools and workflows you need to gain insight from data. While there are *many* excellent software platforms that you could use to *do* data science (see [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-ca/what-is-power-bi/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/why-tableau/what-is-tableau), [Python](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), and [Julia](https://juliadatascience.io)), we will strictly be using R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). I've chosen this approach for three main reasons: (1) open source solutions are more accessible than proprietary tools (e.g., Power BI and Tableau) for reproducibility, (2) the tidyverse features a more consistent design philosophy than other curated package suites (e.g., Anaconda), and (3) the online learning community that has assembled around R and the tidyverse is large, active, and welcoming (start [here](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity?lang=en) to get involved).

Over the course of the next eight weeks we'll work together to learn how to program in R, use tools from the tidyverse to wrangle and visualize data, and put all of this knowledge into action through partnerships with campus stakeholders to address pressing institutional challenges using data-based insights and solutions. Wowzers, when I write it all out like this it sounds so rad!
